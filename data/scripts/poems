malinga will-take-wicket in every spell
mumbai will-win the I P L

ba ba black sheep, have you any wool
yes sir, yes sir, three bags full
one for by master, one for my dame
one for the little boy, who lives down the lane

rajasthan royals, have you any players
why not, why not, we have them all
watson will score runs, dravid will stand
sreesanth will bowl, we will have trophy in hand

jack and jill went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water
jack fell down and broke his crown
and jill came tumbling after

gayle and kohli went up the ground
to score a total of two hundred
gayle hit sixes and kohli hit fours
and bangalore came winning after
